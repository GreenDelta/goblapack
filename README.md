#goblapack
goblapack is a thin Go layer for calling functions of the high performance
math library [OpenBLAS](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS) from Go. It
currently only contains a limited set of functions. For more complete BLAS and
LAPACK bindings in Go, please have a look at the packages provided by the
[gonum team](https://github.com/gonum).
